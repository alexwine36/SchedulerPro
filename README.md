Currently running on a "MAMP" server on my mac
At the center it is running off of an "XAMPP" server
After a bit of research it seemed like php was the safest most well doumented
and most cross compatible option we had. The computer that we are using
is a dinosaur. I tried to run the fancier stuff but it was just not
possible for us.

The beauty of xampp and mamp is that there is still python integration
Currently my biggest fear is parsing the .ics format into the database


In the update_ics.php file there is an array to loop through the
iCal output from outlook.
I am pretty sure it could work there is apparently a (relatively) 
easy way to run python scripts in php if you could do that I would be
incredulously grateful!
